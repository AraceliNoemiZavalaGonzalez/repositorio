    <h1>The Concept Kings: VIXX and their brilliant Music Videos</h1>
    <p class="lora-400">Through the years, K-Pop groups have delivered many concepts, from the usual and expected down to those out of this world and out of the ordinary. These concepts become the underlying theme right beside the message of the song itself, sometimes a concept to complement the lyrics, but in other cases, acts as a contradictory theme and set apart from the song lyrics. </p>
    <p>Other groups even use these concepts as a theme connected to the overarching storyline built up in the alternate universe used by the group, providing much more significant meaning to the general and specific details seen in their music videos. Even such groups have storylines connected to other groups within their label or company, building a bigger alternative universe that envelops each of them. These leave fans scraping for more details and clues, ending up theorizing about what could happen and what would the next concept be.</p>
    <p>But aside from the concepts that feature complex webs of theories and storylines, some concepts exist as is, taken literally and without much more complexity. Some concepts are meant to simply refresh or to fit in with the usual image of the group or whenever season the song will be released. Many groups from the past up until the recent proved that there is no doubt that each concept continues to be amazing, with everyone delivering through their ways and pulling off concepts that may sound unbelievable to many. Among these groups shine the six-member boy group, VIXX, which was dubbed by K-Pop fans, critics, and people in the industry alike as the King of Concepts.</p>

    <h2>Super Hero</h2>
    <p>Super Hero is VIXX's debut track, released on May 24, 2012, serving as the group's debut single and single album. You can definitely see that the concept way back then was their youthful and refreshing charms, as they just recently debuted. The song's fresh pop sound and trendy synth chord patterns match the bright colors in the music video and the fashionable clothing during that era.</p>
    <p>The lyrics and the music video introduce you to the young VIXX, the rookies who will be your superhero even if they are just starting, and the journey of how they will eventually make imaginations into a reality.</p>
    <h3>Voodoo Doll</h3>
    <p>Voodoo Doll is the title track of their full-length album Voodoo, which will eventually help VIXX earn their first music show win since their debut. To minors and to people of the faint heart, one should be slightly careful as one may get triggered by the various graphic scenes depicted in the music video, which was tagged as rated 19. The concept is really grotesque and unsettling- one may even describe it as creepy or shocking, but it was a way to express the connection of the members to the voodoo doll. According to the lyrics, the VIXX members portray previous boyfriends who mistreated the girl in the music video, and the song is written from the viewpoint of the voodoo doll itself. The doll appears to be in love with the girl and swears retribution on anyone who wrongs her by offering itself up and making the members pay, explaining the fact why the members feel trapped while the lyrics are similar to a pledge.</p>

    <p>Shangri-La is the fourth mini-album by VIXX, which features the single of the same name. Aside from the storyline, the music video is very aesthetically pleasing, with some viewers and fans even commenting that each frame seems like a painting, with themes of fantasy referencing a metaphor of utopia tangentially connected to Tao Yuan Ming‘s Peach Blossom Spring Poems. Shangri-La manages to preserve the underlying dark concepts, which is a trademark of VIXX's MVs while reworking this in a sensual rather than a Gothic horror one by blending luscious colors, sharp outlines, and subtle Chinese aesthetic influences and an abstract but compelling fantasy environment.</p>
